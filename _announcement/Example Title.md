      <p>
        The level of care you receive will be consistent no matter which doctor you choose to enrol with under Healthier SG. There are standard care protocols to guide our GPs in managing chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and lipid disorders. The protocols will also cover health screenings, medications, lifestyle adjustments, and referrals to specialist and acute care when necessary.</p>

    <label for="accordion4">What are the key benefits of Healthier SG?</label>
    <div>
      <p>Good health is not just about the absence of diseases or illness. It is a state of complete physical, emotional and social well-being.  Having a long-term, trusted relationship with a family clinic allows your doctor to focus more on preventive care to help you stay healthy, detect health issues early and manage them well.</p>

			<p>Healthier SG empowers you to take steps to improve your health proactively with the support of your trusted family clinic and community partners, every step of the way. </p>

<li>One-time free first Health Plan consultation with your chosen clinic.
</li><li>Healthpoints (worth $20) through Healthy 365 app after the first Health Plan consultation.
</li><li>Free nationally recommended screenings and vaccinations

    <label for="accordion6">Can my family doctor refer me for specialist care? Will referrals made under Healthier SG be subsidised at Specialist Outpatient Centre (SOC) rates, similar to those referred by polyclinics?</label>
    <div>
    <p>Yes, your family doctor can refer you for specialist care if it is clinically appropriate. Your doctor (or the care team) will discuss with you prior to making any referral for specialist care. </p>
 
<p>Singapore Citizens may be referred during their subsidised visits to GP clinics (e.g. under CHAS, SFL, VCDSS) to public SOC for subsidised care. You will be considered as a subsidised patient and will receive care from a team of doctors/dentists.  Patients who wish to choose a specific doctor will have to pay private rates.  </p>

    <label for="accordion9">Are there plans for those aged below 40 years old to be included in Healthier SG?</label>
    <div>
    <p> Our population is ageing rapidly with older age groups more susceptible to co-morbidities and chronic illnesses. As such, Healthier SG enrolment will focus on those aged 40 and above to proactively prevent them from falling ill and delay the deterioration of health. We will consider further expansions after the roll-out has stabilised.</p>

<p>Pre-enrolment will begin in May 2023 for residents aged 40 and above with chronic illnesses and who are already seeing a Healthier SG-registered GP. This will be followed by registration for residents aged 60 and above from July 2023.</p>

<p>In the meantime, all residents should continue to stay active and live healthily. There are a variety of community programmes available, including:
</p><ul>
<li>People’s Association (PA) activities</li>
<li>SportSG ActiveHealth programmes</li>
<li>Health Promotion Board’s (HPB) National Steps Challenge and Eat, Drink, Shop Healthy Challenge</li></ul>

    <input id="accordion11" type="checkbox">
    <label for="accordion11">Instead of GP clinic, can I enrol with polyclinic?</label>
    <div>
      You are strongly advised to enrol with a Healthier SG Clinic to enjoy a long-term trusted relationship with a family doctor who knows you well, and better preventive care and chronic disease management. Healthcare clusters and community partners will work with your family doctor to support your needs.

<p>You can do so via HealthHub, or go to a Community Centre or Joint Testing &amp; Vaccination Centres (JTVC). You may also call the MOH hotline at 6325 9220.</p>

<p>We will support one change of enrolled clinic in a year to accommodate personal preferences and changes in life circumstances, e.g. families who move house.  As some residents may need more time to find a clinic that they are comfortable with at the start, we will support up to four changes for the initial enrolment period.</p>

    <input id="accordion13" type="checkbox">
    <label for="accordion13">Why can’t I find my Healthier SG clinic of choice? What do I do if my existing General Practitioner (GP) is not a Healthier SG-registered clinic?</label>
    <div>
      <p>For Healthier SG, residents can enrol only with a Healthier SG-registered clinic that is participating in Healthier SG. GP clinics that are not Healthier SG-registered will not be available for selection.</p>

<p>As you will need to enrol with a Healthier SG-registered GP clinic to access Healthier SG benefits, you are strongly encouraged to choose from the list of Healthier SG-registered clinics in HealthHub.</p>

<p>You may continue to visit non-Healthier SG clinics even after your enrolment. However, Healthier SG benefits will not be applicable at clinics that you are not enrolled with and only prevailing schemes such as CHAS and MediSave will apply.</p>

<p>If your preferred GP is not on Healthier SG, do encourage your preferred GP to enrol on Healthier SG!</p>
